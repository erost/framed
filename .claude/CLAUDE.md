# Guidelines
- Write tests as part of each tasks
- Write inline documentation as part of each task
- Structure the code according to the language and framework best practices

# Code quality
- Write small, readable methods and functions
- Aim for GLOBAL code coverage above 60%
- check that all tests are running at the end of every task
- ask if the linter and formatter should be run after the end of every task

# Libraries
- vuejs: use it as the main frontend framework. it's lightweight, well supported, and component based
- konva: use konva from konvajs to interact with the Canvas API
- tailwind CSS: use it as a base for the layout and look and feel.

# Documentation
- the documentation you produce and update as you make changes and fixes is in the "documentation" subfolder present in this directory.
- the user facing documentation, mostly related to how to run tasks like linters and tests should be added in the README.md file at the root of the project.
- no implementation or design details, including completed tasks or bug fixed, should be added in the user facing documentation.
- before adding new documentation files, always asks for confirmation.
